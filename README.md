Smart Playlist Intelligence System

This project is a Python program that analyzes a music playlist using song durations provided by the user. Based on simple conditions, the program categorizes the playlist and gives an appropriate recommendation.

Problem Description

A playlist is represented as a list of song durations in seconds. The program validates the input, calculates the total duration, checks for repeated values, and classifies the playlist as Balanced, Repetitive, Too Short, Too Long, or Irregular.

Approach Used

The program first takes user input for the number of songs and their durations. It checks for invalid durations and stops further analysis if any invalid value is found. If the input is valid, the total duration is calculated and repeated song durations are identified. Based on these checks, the playlist is categorized and a recommendation is displayed.

How to Run the Program

Ensure Python is installed on your system.

Run the Python file.

Enter the number of songs and their durations when prompted.

View the playlist category and recommendation.

Sample Output
Total Duration: 810 seconds
Songs: 4
Category: Balanced Playlist
Recommendation: Good listening session
Learning Outcome

This project helped in understanding the use of lists, loops, conditional statements, and basic input validation in Python.

Personalization Applied

The program uses user-provided inputs such as the number of songs and song durations, making the analysis dynamic and personalized for each run.
